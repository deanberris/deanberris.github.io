  <h1 class="page-heading">Insights from Chilling Out</h1>
  <p><b>I am a logorrheic geek, writing about my adventures and experiences.</b></p>
  <p>I am a migrant to Sydney, New South Wales, Australia from Manila,
  Philippines who has been around the IT industry for long enough to have
  enough stories to share. I've been a student, an entrepreneur, an employee,
  and a consultant. I'm also currently a husband to an amazing wife, a father
  to two amazing kids, and a software engineer in a big tech company.</p>
  <p>This is my latest experiment in building and establishing relationships
  with like-minded people out to make the world a better place through
  technology. This space is dedicated to highlighting not only
  <a href="/who-is-dean">who I am</a> but a collection of thoughts going out through
  my <a href="/newsletter">newsletter</a>.</p>
